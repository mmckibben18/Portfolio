# Week 8 Ex. 8.3

## Introduction
  Global awareness and tolerance of mental health conditions have been increasing rapidly in the last few years. However, a recent comprehensive analysis of the prevalence and most effective treatments of anxiety is not something I've come across. Mental illness and, specifically, anxiety is a topic that affects a great many people. Whether you are afflicted or have a spouse, relative, or friend who deals with mental illness, the impact of anxiety on a person's quality of life can touch nearly everyone. In order to determine the prevalence of anxiety and the effectiveness of various treatments, we will look at several datasets that provide recent, relevant information. R will be critical in analyzing this much data from these expansive datasets. While the World Health Organization published a study in 2019, and the NIH published a study using data from 2001 - 2004, I'd like to see how a more recent analysis will compare with their findings. This data and our inferences can be checked against the 2019 WHO analysis to see the progression of anxiety's pervasiveness and treatment options in the last five years and against the NIH study to see the change in the last 20 years.

## Research questions
  What are the most prevalent symptoms of anxiety?
How many people experience symptoms of anxiety?
Are specific demographics affected more heavily by anxiety?
In the last five years, has the number of people affected by anxiety changed from the WHO study's predictions?
In the last 20 years, has the number of people affected by anxiety changed from the NIH study?
What medications are available to treat anxiety?
Which medications appear to be most effective at treating anxiety?
How many cases of anxiety are managed by the most effective medications?

## Approach
  The first part of the analysis will deal with datasets that involve the symptoms that indicate an anxiety disorder. We can establish trends from the number of people experiencing symptoms versus those diagnosed and possibly create theories about its pervasiveness; this will dovetail with the second part of our analysis. The second step will be to work with different global datasets to determine the trends of the prevalence of anxiety disorders and compare the data results between the first two analysis phases to see if our prediction about the number of people affected matches up. The last step will look at a dataset that has ratings of the effectiveness of psychiatric medications, which we will narrow down to anxiety. We can take the trends of prevalence and compare them to the effectiveness of various medications and make a supposition about whether or not certain medications seem more effective at treating anxiety. We can examine all of our datasets to see if specific demographics are particularly susceptible to experiencing anxiety and if certain medications are more effective for different demographic groups as well. We can use the data from the first two parts of our analysis and cross-correlate with the number of people prescribed effective medications to make a conjecture about how many cases of anxiety are well managed. 

## How your approach addresses (fully or partially) the problem.
  The datasets I intend to use are more recent than those from the 2019 WHO study which used data from 2018 and 2019 and the 20-year-old data from the NIH study. I have selected six datasets, two from 2022 and the remaining four updated this year. Once I've analyzed all of this more recent data, I can compare this new information with the WHO and NIH studies and see if there have been unaccounted-for changes.

## Required Packages
At least:
purrr
tidyverse
Metrics
ggplot2

## Plots and Table Needs
We will need quite a few plots and tables. At least:
Number of people experiencing anxiety symptoms
	globally
	% globally
	by country
	% by country
	by demographic
	% by demographic
Number of people diagnosed with anxiety
	globally
	% globally
	by country
	% by country
	by demographic
	% by demographic
The most prevalent anxiety symptoms
	globally
	% globally
	by country
	% by country
	by demographic
	% by demographic
Most prevalent medications
	globally
	% globally
	by country
	% by country
	by demographic
	% by demographic
Ratings of medications
Number of people taking specified medication
The number of cases we predict will be well-managed

## Questions for future steps
  Do we anticipate the trends in prevalence we've found to continue over the next five years? The following 10, 20?
Do we anticipate the number of people with anxiety that is well-managed to change? How? 
Are there newer medications that we do not have data on?
Do we expect the representation of those diagnosed in specific demographics to change? How?

## What do you not know how to do right now that you need to learn to answer your research questions?
  I think I have all the resources and information I need to complete this project; it will just take time.

## Data Importing and Cleaning
  The first step to take is going to be importing all of the data from the csv files. After that it will be to parse the data in order to condense the datasets down to the appropriate columns. Once the data has been parsed we will remove rows with missing data to create datasets that have all the necessary columns. The code in the above section prints the kept columns and first eight rows of each dataset.

## Exceptions
Unfortunately, the dataset that has the symptoms isn't very useable. I don't believe this first dataset is actually useful for me. There's lots of data but not useful for this particalur analysis. 
  
## Data Discovery
  The data from the indicators dataset seems very promising. It breaks down the data by date, age group, ethnicity, gender, education level, and state. We can group the data by these categories throughout the timeframes that all the categories span. We should then make plots over time for all of these values. We can then look to the global_mental dataset and find the prevalence per country. In that prevalence dataset we can average the prevalence between male and female and compare that to the results from the indicators and global_mental datasets. We can then compare the prevalence by male or female from the indicator groups, and compare that to the mental and prevalence datasets sorted by gender. We should average all the results for female and male from all of the datasets. We can then look at the treatment dataset from WebMD and see how many people are receiving treatment and what medications they are taking. This can also be broken down by gender for more information. To answer our research questions we look at the prevalence of anxiety per location, gender, race, and age. Then we can look at the effectiveness of medication for each group. 

## Variables and Data Preparation
  I think that the datasets have all the appropriate variables aside from the cumulative female and male results. We can compare all of our results to the NIH and WHO findings. And all of the results can be used in comparisons plots for all of the demographic categories.

## Machine Learning
  I'm not sure how to incorporate machine learning currently. I've removed some categories from the datasets that could potentially be useful for making models that predict anxiety from symptoms, demographics, and comorbidities. If I could make this model I think machine learning would be useful in order to look at more datasets.

## For the Future
  I think making models and using machine learning to look at new data would be something I'd really like to do. There are some ethical and privacy concerns with doing this though.
  
## Things to Learn
  The first dataset has a text field that I'm unsure how to parse for symptoms in R. The way I would approach this would be to parse the whole text field down into individual words. I'd then compare the words individually to a list of symptoms I defined. Alternatively, I'd probably need AI to parse the text field to find all the symptoms. That may be the better way to search through the text field because doing it myself does not account for if someone says these are symptoms they're not experiencing. The string comparison method only looks for the presence of a word not the context.
  I'd also like to know how to print nice tables of data both in R and to files from R.
