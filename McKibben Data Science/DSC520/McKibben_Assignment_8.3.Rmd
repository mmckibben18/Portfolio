# Introduction
Global awareness and tolerance of mental health conditions have been increasing rapidly in the last few years. However, a recent comprehensive analysis of the prevalence and most effective treatments of anxiety is not something I've come across. Mental illness and, specifically, anxiety is a topic that affects a great many people. Whether you are afflicted or have a spouse, relative, or friend who deals with mental illness, the impact of anxiety on a person's quality of life can touch nearly everyone. In order to determine the prevalence of anxiety and the effectiveness of various treatments, we will look at several datasets that provide recent, relevant information. R will be critical in analyzing this much data from these expansive datasets. While the World Health Organization published a study in 2019, and the NIH published a study using data from 2001 - 2004, I'd like to see how a more recent analysis will compare with their findings. This data and our inferences can be checked against the 2019 WHO analysis to see the progression of anxiety's pervasiveness and treatment options in the last five years and against the NIH study to see the change in the last 20 years.

# Research questions
What are the most prevalent symptoms of anxiety?
How many people experience symptoms of anxiety?
Are specific demographics affected more heavily by anxiety?
In the last five years, has the number of people affected by anxiety changed from the WHO study's predictions?
In the last 20 years, has the number of people affected by anxiety changed from the NIH study?
What medications are available to treat anxiety?
Which medications appear to be most effective at treating anxiety?
How many cases of anxiety are managed by the most effective medications?

# Approach
The first part of the analysis will deal with datasets that involve the symptoms that indicate an anxiety disorder. We can establish trends from the number of people experiencing symptoms versus those diagnosed and possibly create theories about its pervasiveness; this will dovetail with the second part of our analysis. The second step will be to work with different global datasets to determine the trends of the prevalence of anxiety disorders and compare the data results between the first two analysis phases to see if our prediction about the number of people affected matches up. The last step will look at a dataset that has ratings of the effectiveness of psychiatric medications, which we will narrow down to anxiety. We can take the trends of prevalence and compare them to the effectiveness of various medications and make a supposition about whether or not certain medications seem more effective at treating anxiety. We can examine all of our datasets to see if specific demographics are particularly susceptible to experiencing anxiety and if certain medications are more effective for different demographic groups as well. We can use the data from the first two parts of our analysis and cross-correlate with the number of people prescribed effective medications to make a conjecture about how many cases of anxiety are well managed. 

# How your approach addresses (fully or partially) the problem.
The datasets I intend to use are more recent than those from the 2019 WHO study which used data from 2018 and 2019 and the 20-year-old data from the NIH study. I have selected six datasets, two from 2022 and the remaining four updated this year. Once I've analyzed all of this more recent data, I can compare this new information with the WHO and NIH studies and see if there have been unaccounted-for changes.

# Plots and Table Needs
We will need quite a few plots and tables. At least:
Number of people experiencing anxiety symptoms
	globally
	% globally
	by country
	% by country
	by demographic
	% by demographic
Number of people diagnosed with anxiety
	globally
	% globally

	% by demographic
Most prevalent medications
	globally
	% globally

	% by country
	by demographic
	% by demographic
Ratings of medications
Number of people taking specified medication
The number of cases we predict will be well-managed

# Questions for future steps
Do we anticipate the trends in prevalence we've found to continue over the next five years? The following 10, 20?
Do we anticipate the number of people with anxiety that is well-managed to change? How? 
Are there newer medications that we do not have data on?
Do we expect the representation of those diagnosed in specific demographics to change? How?

# What do you not know how to do right now that you need to learn to answer your research questions?
I think I have all the resources and information I need to complete this project; it will just take time.
