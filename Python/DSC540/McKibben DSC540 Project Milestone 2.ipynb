    "Changing the data was primarily done to split the data by condition, remove rows with missing values that would hinder our analysis when combined with the other data sources, and prepare the reviews for sentiment analysis. There are HIPAA regulations for medical data, but we do not need to worry about them as the data is already anonymous. We've lost some entries by removing rows with missing values, which could influence downstream analysis. There is an assumption that the removed rows were a relatively even distribution of the different data types specified by the column headers and that we aren't skewing our results. By stemming the reviews, we prepare them for sentiment analysis, but they can become incoherent to read when stemmed. We also assume that the program can do the sentiment analysis on 1000 entries well enough and that it is not mandatory for me to go in and do my own sentiment analysis. My dataset came from Kaggle, which came directly from WebMD, where the users first entered their information. There are no ethical concerns about how I obtained the dataset, and I did not run into any ethical dilemmas while working with this dataset."
