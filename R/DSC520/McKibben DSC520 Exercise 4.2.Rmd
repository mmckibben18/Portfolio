# Observational units are the number of students achieving a certain score and

# (Count) Number of students is quantitative
# Scores is quantitative
# Section is categorical

# Separating the data by section

# From looking at the graphs we are able to see that the Sports section had a wide distribution 
# encompassing both the lowest and highest scores of either section. The Sports section also had 
# a lower mean than the regular section indicating that the regular section scored higher on average.

# No each group of students were dispersed, with no section scoring absolutely higher than the other.
# The statistical tendency in this case is meaning that students in the regular lecture scored, on 
# average, higher than their sports counterparts. Not every student scored higher though, and the 
# sports category had the highest score overall, but comparing the means of each section we see that
# the regular lecture was ~20 points higher on average.

# Could be the time of day of the lecture, the gender make-up of the section, or the level of investment
# from each course section. If a bunch of jocks (I was one so allow me to trash them slightly here) are 
# only enrolled because it's a requirement and they just need to get a C to stay on the team they will
# not be as invested as the other section is in their performance. The sports section
# scored lower but there could be an indicator that that section appealed more to the sporty people.
